### XP Core Value - Build 'Integrity' in

* “Integrity” is defined as “free from flaw, defect, and decay”. We target many ways to build integrity into our project:

### Free from 'flaw'
We avoid flaws in our game development by aligning the progress with the final deleiverable. We priotize our tasks effectively and focus on everyone completes it within deadline. We take care that each update to our game meets the user's requirement. We use Phaser Editor to carry out the testind at each stage.

### Free from 'defect'
TDD approach decreases the amount of time to progress from introduction of defect to actually fix it. Team notes down all test cases possible before actually implementing the functionality. 

### Free from 'decay'
Point one highlights the practice of prioritizing hign values items over others, which eventually decreases the amount of decay introduced into the game. We, as a team, monitor that every update to the game takes care of the end result. We also admire continuous integration to minimize decay in our game by notifying everyone about the flaw as soon as they are inroduced.

* So, it is equally important to understand 'integrity' and how we as a team implements it in the process of game development. The above practice will help us deliver our project in time with great features.
