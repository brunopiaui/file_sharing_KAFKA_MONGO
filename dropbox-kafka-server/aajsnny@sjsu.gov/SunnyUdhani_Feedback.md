### XP Core Value - Feedback

* We have provied feedback and improvements on developmental work of each other, so that we can deliver the best possible. 
* In the stand-up meeting everyone shared important feedback related to game's architecture, levels, desig patterns, etc.
* Feedback was taken seriously and changes were implemented immediately to reciprocate on it.
* Feedback will prove crucial for game's overall integration process.
